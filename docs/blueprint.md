## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FA) â€“ subtle and non-intrusive, ensuring the deep indigo elements command the most attention, in line with a light scheme.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), chosen to guide the user journey through calls to action and clickable elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, is used for most of the portfolio because it has a neutral and modern look. Headline Font: 'Playfair', serif, should be used for titles/headlines.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Custom designed icons to mirror sections, professional achievements and skillset which blends fluidly with the theme.
- Whitespace allocation to prioritize legibility, uncluttered user experience, using strategic spacings between sections and content groups.
- Subtle transition effects when scrolling, button-hovers, micro-interactions, element-reveal effects creating engagement without hindering overall user experience.
